Below are outputs from my program, basically it write to this .txt file as:
User with email: 'email input from program' report 'this email' as 'type of email'
and include with source email as:
Email source found: 'after the @'
This way, we can check whether an email is valid or suspicious.
Require checking and maintaining daily to ensure, no fraud email is reported as Valid and vice versa.
